        <p>
            Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's</br>
            nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what i had in</br>
            mind. The type is all Helvetica, which I like, but is doesn't excite me at all. There is just no</br>
            character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need</br>
            something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.</br>
