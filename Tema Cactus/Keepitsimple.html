        <p>
            Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? 
            There's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. 
            That's not what i had in mind. The type is all Helvetica, which I like, but 
            it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. 
            It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need something
            to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.
